Python script that utilizes the Keras library to build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting Apple's stock prices based on historical data. The script uses Yahoo Finance (yfinance) to fetch historical stock data for Apple, performs data preprocessing and scaling, builds the LSTM model, and then makes predictions.

Here's a summary of the steps performed in the code:

Importing necessary libraries, such as math, pandas_datareader, numpy, pandas, MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn, Keras (TensorFlow backend), and matplotlib for visualization.

Fetching Apple's historical stock data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) from January 1, 2012, to May 31, 2023.

Preprocessing the data and scaling it using MinMaxScaler to fit the values within the range of 0 to 1.

Creating the training dataset by taking the first 80% of the data and preparing input sequences (x_train) and target values (y_train) for the LSTM model. Each input sequence is of length 60 (configurable) based on the previous 60 closing prices.

Building the LSTM model using the Sequential API from Keras, which consists of two LSTM layers and two Dense layers.

Compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function.

Training the model with the training dataset for one epoch (you can experiment with more epochs for better results).

Creating the testing dataset from the remaining 20% of the data and preparing input sequences (x_test) for prediction.

Making predictions on the test data using the trained model, and then scaling back the predictions to the original scale.

Calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the predicted values and the actual test data for evaluation.

Plotting the training data, validation data, and the predicted stock prices for visualization.

Finally, the script fetches Apple's stock data for a specific date range (May 31, 2023, to June 2, 2023), predicts the stock price for the next day using the last 60 days of historical data, and then saves the data to a CSV file and downloads it.

It's important to note that the prediction model in this code is relatively simple and may not capture all the complexities of real-world stock price movements. Additionally, using historical stock prices to predict future prices has inherent limitations, as stock markets are influenced by various unpredictable factors.# stock-price-prediction
